            <h3 class="faq-title">How do I add my own scripts?</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Duplicate the <code>__stub.js</code> file inside the
                    <code>/src/algos/scripts</code> directory and rename it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the <code>/src/algos/index.ts</code>, copy/paste one of
                    the existing entries and change the values to suit your
                    algorithm. Unfortunately, due to how webpack imports
                    webworkers - the paths to scripts must be written out at
                    build-time and we can't map algorithm names to paths at
                    run-time. If you know how to solve this problem - be sure to
                    submit a PR :).

                What information does the framework provide? What is the script
                expected to return?
            </h3>
            <p>
                The framework provides the maze dimensions, start and end
                position coordinates and an array with coordinates of the walls.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your script should return an array path coordinate pairs [row,
                column], which will be drawn as the path in the maze.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's a <code>__stub.js</code> file in the
                <code>/src/algos/scripts</code> folder. Copy it for your own
                script and use it as a guide for what your script accepts and
                returns.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's also a sample algorithm (mrgd.js) written by
                <a href="https://github.com/mr9d/">Aleksandr Kozlov</a>.
            </p>

                I'm getting a security error when I try initiating pathfinding.

            <p>
                You can't load web workers when running scripts from a local
                file. Serve the page through a web-server (like the "Live
                Server" plugin for VS Code).
