    <title>Maze framework - How to add your own scripts</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main class="howto-main">
      <h1>Where do I add my own scripts?</h1>
      <p>Your .js files go in the <i>/algos/</i> directory.</p>
      <h1>
        What information does the framework provide? What is the script expected
        to return?
      </h1>
      <p>
        The framework provides the maze dimensions, start and end position
        coordinates and an array with coordinates of the walls.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your script should return an array path coordinate pairs [row, column],
        which will be drawn as the path in the maze.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a <i>__stub.js</i> file in the <i>/algos/</i> folder. Copy it
        for your own script and use it as a guide for what your script accepts
        and returns.
      </p>
      <h1>
        How do I make my scripts appear in the pathfinding algorithms menu?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Currently, you have to add your script files in the index.html as an
        option for the select.algo-select.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your options should look like
        <code>&ltoption value="filename.js">Algorithm name&lt/option></code>
      </p>
      <p>Don't add the file path, just the file name of your script in the <i>/algos/</i> folder</p>
      <h1>
        I think my script is going to take a really long time to execute. Will
        this hang the tab?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Scripts are executed on a separate thread, using webworkers. Your tab
        should be fine :)
      </p>
      <h1>I'm getting a security error when I try initiating pathfinding.</h1>
      <p>
        You can't load web workers when running scripts from a local file. Open
        the page through a web-server (like the "Live Server" plugin for VS
        Code).
