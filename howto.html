Change object key, path to the algorithm script and <code>displayName</code> to suit your algorithm. It should look something like this:<pre>
                        <code>
algo_name: {
    worker: new Worker(new URL("./scripts/algo_name.js", import.meta.url)),
    displayName: "My algorithm's name",
},
                        </code>
                    </pre>Unfortunately, due to how webpack imports webworkers - the paths to scripts must be written out at build-time and we can't map algorithm names to paths at run-time. If you know how to solve this problem - be sure to submit a PR :).</li></ol><h3 class="faq-title">What information does the framework provide? What is the script expected to return?</h3><p>The framework provides the maze dimensions, start and end position coordinates and an array with coordinates of the walls.</p><p>Your script should return an array path coordinate pairs [row, column], which will be drawn as the path in the maze.</p><p>There's a <code>__stub.js</code> file in the <code>/src/algos/scripts</code> folder. Copy it for your own script and use it as a guide for what your script accepts and returns.</p><p>There's also a sample algorithm (mrgd.js) written by <a href="https://github.com/mr9d/">Aleksandr Kozlov</a>.</p><h3 class="faq-title">I'm getting a security error when I try initiating pathfinding.</h3><p>You can't load web workers when running scripts from a local file. Serve the page through a web-server (like the "Live Server" plugin for VS Code).</p><h3 class="faq-title">Attributions</h3><p>Framework by Javid Bunyadzade. Contact me at <a href="mailto:j.bunyadzade@gmail.com">j.bunyadzade@gmail.com</a> for feedback and questions or if you want your script to be featured here!</p><p>Huge thanks to <a href="https://github.com/mr9d/">Aleksandr Kozlov</a> for graciously taking the time to test the framework and providing the mrgd.js script.</p><p>Thanks to my good friend <a href="https://github.com/asadovkamran">Kamran Asadov</a> for providing his blazing-fast implementation of the Wave Propagation algorithm!</p></main><div class="back-container"><a href="index.html">&lt;&lt; Back</a></div></body></html>
